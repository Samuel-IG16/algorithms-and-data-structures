      1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5,
      between 1500 and 2700 (both included).
      2. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three
      print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers
      which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
      3. Write a Python program to find the sum of two given integers. However, if the sum is
      between 15 and 20 it will return 20
      4. Write a Python program to print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th
      elements. Sample List : ['Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Black', 'Pink', 'Yellow']
      Expected Output : ['Green', 'White', 'Black']
      5. Write a python code that prints all odd numbers between 1 and 100 using a while
      statement.
      6. Write a program to accept percentage from the user and display the grade according to
      the following criteria:
          Marks Grade
          > 90 A
          > 80 and <= 90 B
          >= 60 and <= 80 C
          below 60 D
      7. Write a program to accept a number from 1 to 7 and display the name of the day like 1

          ● print out the name of a person whose birthday is stored in the database
          ● if the person’s name is not in the database you should print “I do not have
          birthday information for [name]”

          birthday of [name]”
      9. Write a program to create a function that takes two arguments, name and age, and print
      their value.
      10. Define a function in python that accepts 3 values and returns the maximum of three
      numbers.
      11. Write a python code that loops from 1 to 60 with the following specifications:
          a. It prints “Multiple of 3” when the loop variable is a multiple of 3
          b. It prints “Multiple of 4” when the loop variable is a multiple of 4
          c. It prints “Multiple of 3 and 4” when the loop variable is a multiple of
          d. both 3 and 4
          e. Otherwise, it prints the loop variable
